then`\n- Exit on critical failures: `exit 1`\n- Use `pause()` for user confirmation before dangerous ops\n\n#### Variables\n- Uppercase for constants: `CTX=16384`, `VRAM_MB`, `ETH_IFACE`\n- Detect hardware dynamically (don't hardcode)\n- Quote variables: `\"$ETH_IFACE\"`, not `$ETH_IFACE`\n\n#### Naming Conventions\n- Script names: `phase1-setup.sh`, `upgrade-script.sh` (kebab-case)\n- Functions: `info()`, `pause()`, `step()` (lowercase, descriptive)\n- Variables: `VRAM_MB`, `ETH_CON`, `GPU_TIER` (SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE)\n\n#### NetworkManager Commands\n```bash\n# Find interface\nnmcli -t -f DEVICE,TYPE device | grep ethernet\n\n# Create connection\nsudo nmcli con add type ethernet con-name gpu-lan ifname \"$IFACE\" \\\n  ipv4.addresses 10.0.0.1/24 \\\n  ipv4.method manual\n\n# Modify connection (remove gateway for non-internet connection)\nsudo nmcli con mod \"$CON\" ipv4.gateway \"\" ipv4.dns \"\"\n\n# Apply\nsudo nmcli con up \"$CON\"\n```\n\n#### Systemd Overrides\n```bash\n# Create override directory\nsudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/ollama.service.d\n\n# Write override file\ncat <<'EOF' | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/ollama.service.d/override.conf\n[Service]\nEnvironment=\"OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0\"\nEOF\n\n# Reload and restart\nsudo systemctl daemon-reload\nsudo systemctl restart ollama\n```\n\n#### Output Clarity\n- Use `step()` to mark major sections\n- Use `info()` for success, `warn()` for caution, `err()` for failures\n- Echo instructions clearly before interactive commands\n- Show summary at end (GPU model, IP, services)\n\n---\n\n## Configuration Management\n\n### Ollama Configuration\n```bash\n# Context window (interactive)\nollama run qwen3:8b\n/set parameter num_ctx 16384\n/save qwen3:8b\n/bye\n\n# Verify settings\ncurl http://10.0.0.1:11434/api/show -d '{\"name\":\"qwen3:8b\"}' | jq\n```\n\n### OpenCode Configuration\nLocation: `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"provider\": {\n    \"ollama\": {\n      \"npm\": \"@ai-sdk/openai-compatible\",\n      \"name\": \"GPU PC Ollama\",\n      \"options\": { \"baseURL\": \"http://10.0.0.1:11434/v1\" },\n      \"models\": {\n        \"qwen3:8b\": {\n          \"name\": \"Qwen3 8B (GPU PC)\",\n          \"limit\": { \"context\": 16384, \"output\": 4096 }\n        },\n        \"qwen2.5:7b\": {\n          \"name\": \"Qwen2.5 7B (GPU PC)\",\n          \"limit\": { \"context\": 16384, \"output\": 4096 }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Agent Configuration\nLocation: `~/.config/opencode/agents/*.md`\n\nFront matter format:\n```yaml\n---\ndescription: Brief description\nmode: subagent\nmodel: ollama/qwen2.5:7b\ntemperature: 0.1\npermission:\n  read: allow\n  glob: allow\n  grep: allow\n  bash: deny\n  edit: deny\n  write: deny\n---\n```\n\n---\n\n## Common Patterns\n\n### VRAM-Based Decisions\n```bash\nVRAM_MB=$(nvidia-smi --query-gpu=memory.total --format=csv,noheader,nounits | head -1 | tr -d ' ')\nif [[ \"$VRAM_MB\" -ge 11000 ]]; then\n    CTX=32768  # 3060 12GB\nelse\n    CTX=16384  # 2060 6GB\nfi\n```\n\n### Interface Detection\n```bash\nETH_IFACE=$(nmcli -t -f DEVICE,TYPE device | grep ethernet | head -1 | cut -d: -f1)\nif [[ -z \"$ETH_IFACE\" ]]; then\n    err \"No ethernet interface found\"\n    exit 1\nfi\n```\n\n### Internet Connectivity Check\n```bash\nif ! ping -c 1 -W 3 google.com &>/dev/null; then\n    err \"No internet.\"\n    exit 1\nfi\n```\n\n---\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Script Failures\n- Check logs: `journalctl -xe`\n- Verify syntax: `bash -n script.sh`\n- Run with debug: `bash -x script.sh`\n\n### Ollama Issues\n- Service status: `systemctl status ollama`\n- Listening port: `ss -tlnp | grep 11434`\n- Logs: `journalctl -u ollama -f`\n\n### Network Issues\n- IP config: `ip addr show`\n- Routes: `ip route`\n- Firewall: `sudo firewall-cmd --list-all`\n- Test API: `curl http://10.0.0.1:11434/api/tags`\n\n### NVIDIA Driver Issues\n- Rebuild module: `sudo akmods --force && sudo dracut --force && reboot`\n- Check Secure Boot: Must be disabled for unsigned kernel modules\n- Verify load: `lsmod | grep nvidia`\n\n---\n\n## Project Structure\n```\n.\n├── CLAUDE.md              # Project state/decisions (primary doc)\n├── AGENTS.md              # This file (agent guidelines)\n├── phase1-setup.sh        # Pre-reboot setup script\n├── phase1-post-reboot.sh  # Post-reboot full setup\n├── phase1-continue.sh     # Continuation script (if post-reboot fails)\n├── upgrade-script.sh      # Monthly maintenance script\n└── .git/                  # Git repo\n```\n\n---\n\n## Key Facts for Agents\n\n1. **No tests** — this is infra setup, validation is manual\n2. **Destructive operations** — scripts modify systemd, NetworkManager, firewalld\n3. **Requires sudo** — all scripts need elevated privileges\n4. **Interactive prompts** — use `pause()` before risky operations\n5. **Hardware detection** — scripts adapt to RTX 2060 vs 3060 automatically\n6. **Private LAN only** — 10.0.0.0/24, no gateway/DNS on ethernet\n7. **WiFi for internet** — GPU PC keeps WiFi enabled for dnf updates\n8. **Idempotent where possible** — scripts check before creating (e.g., connection exists)\n\nWhen making changes:\n- Preserve error handling (`set -euo pipefail`)\n- Keep output colorized and clear\n- Detect hardware/config dynamically\n- Test on both RTX 2060 and 3060 scenarios (or detect)\n- Update CLAUDE.md when changing architecture/decisions\n"},"timestamp":1770632657324}
